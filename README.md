# HoneyOurHouseIs10FeetUnder

## Game idea

highscore based game
you need to build an apartment that needs to house increasingly more amount of people
and you need it to be able to resist earthquakes/wind etc.

The game randomly gives blocks to you and you must expand

Blocks:

plastic
rope

Wood Square
Wood long Rect
Plastic Circle
Steel Frame

add some guy named jim and his wife
They live in the apartment, and they just come
and after every tour, they come and have some small talk or something

Also add people as entities in the game
like they have special sprites etc.

Man
Child(male or female)
Woman
Cat
Dog
Hamster
Bird
fish in a bowl

Ä°f they die they say "oof" sound(custom made)

for every alive people you get one more extra card
